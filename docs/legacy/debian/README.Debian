nixnote2 for Debian
-------------------

Nixnote2 for Debian does not provide features implemented as plugin, such as
spell checking and webcam support. There are various issues around plugin
structure (see https://github.com/baumgarr/nixnote2/issues/208).

Those missing features will be added back after existing issues get solved.
