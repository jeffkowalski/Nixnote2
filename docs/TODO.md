# TODO / Roadmap
## 1
* Better status bar display on exceptions (shortcuts / 2 part status bar)
* Check relevance evaluation in connection with diacritic removal 
* PDF export
    * Default FN - note title?
    * Maybe open the PDF after export

## 2
* Send email using external email client
* Automatic search after typing text in search box (search box "onchange" => search)
* Improve display with thumbnails
* Copying images from to note/note seems to destroy the note
