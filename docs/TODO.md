# TODO
## 1
* Focus search box after "all notes"
* Improve info related to sync error - e.g. "Unable to update note.  Invalid note 
  structure"
* "unable to save this note"
  * ... either tidy not installed or too complex" wtf
  * improve tidy integration
  * add simplify html function  
* Interface seems freeze sometimes - check/report what is done just at the time (is it indexing?)
* Copying images to note/note seems to destroy the note
* Send email using external email client
* PDF export
    * Pdf export someway takes the OS theme color as background for PDF (dark OS template=>dark bkg in PDF)
    * It seems PDF export file picker stays in background after first PDF export.. then stays hidden=>confusing
    * filedialog should add pdf extension
    * Default FN - note title?
    * OK dialog is useless
* Better preference for date/time (allow data without time)

 "Error uploading note: ...." 
 INFO 2018-06-18 09:21:36.649 ( nixnote.cpp @ 1921 ) "Unable to update note.  Invalid note structure : :EDAMUserException: ENML_VALIDATION parameter=Attribute \"itemprop\" must be declared for element type \"span\"." 

## 2
* Improve search (~title search should not do automatic right truncation)
* Automatic search after typing text in search box (search box "onchange" => search)
* AppImage build
