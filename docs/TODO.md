# TODO
## 1
* Modify ini file groups for v2.1
* Add release notes dialog
* Improve html cleanup (in case of further sync problems)
* Add "simplify html"  
* Update to Qt 5.11 
* Copying images from to note/note seems to destroy the note
* Send email using external email client
* PDF export
    * Pdf export someway takes the background theme color as background for PDF
    * It seems PDF export file picker stays in background after first PDF export.. then stays hidden=>confusing
    * Filedialog should add pdf extension
    * Default FN - note title?
    * OK dialog is useless

## 2
* Improve search 
* Automatic search after typing text in search box (search box "onchange" => search)
* Optional removal of diacritics before search and index - currently mixing words with 
  diacritics and without doesn't work at all
