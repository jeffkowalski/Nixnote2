# TODO
## 1
* Improve info related to sync error - e.g. "Unable to update note.  Invalid note 
  structure"
* Reset table view position to top after search
* Fix text color picker
* Improve description how to build from source
* Clear search term after clicking on all notes


## 2
* Improve status info when sync and/or indexing is running (as it sometimes makes app unusable)
* Improve search (~title search should not do automatic right truncation)
* Automatic search after typing text in search box (search box "onchange" => search)
* Display shortcut info in button tooltip
* AppImage build
